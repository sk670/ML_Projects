 ## Description
 ### By analyzing and observing the given data set we have to predict whether a given tweet is about a real disaster or not.
 ### If so, predict a 1. If not, predict a 0.

 ## Problems solved

 ### Text Normalization 
 #### Stemming and Lemmatization techniques used to prepare text, words for further processing.

 ### Frequecy Distribution
 #### Use to find the frequency of words within a text and it returns a dictionary.

 ### Transform text into a meaningful representation of numbers
 #### Used Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency(TFIDF)

 ## Model Used

 ### 1. SVM Model
 ### 2. Naive Bayes Model
 ### 3. Logistic Regression Model

 ## Selection of Model

 ### Logistic Regression Model, as this gives the higher prediction than the Naive Bayes Model and SVM.

 ## Result

 ### Score of Logistic Regression model is 0.7064
